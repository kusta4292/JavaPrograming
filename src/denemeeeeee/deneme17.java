/*

/*### Create a method called `next3()` that will take an int argument and print the three numbers that come after the given number. The `next3()` method is already called in the main method. Print in the following format:

```
$number1 $number2 $number3

The three next numbers are printed on the same line with spaces between them
```

#### This is a `void` method with an `int` parameter

Main topics: methods, Scanner, primitive datatypes, operators

Example:
```
  next3(1)

output:
  2 3 4
```
Example:
```
  next3(10)

output:
  11 12 13
```
